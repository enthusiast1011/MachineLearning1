# AMD GPUs Performance

As I haven't had a chance to do any serious work with AMD GPUs, just sharing links for now.

- [AMD Instinct MI300X system optimization](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/how-to/system-optimization/mi300x.html)
- [AMD Instinct MI300X workload optimization](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/how-to/tuning-guides/mi300x/workload.html)

## Profilers

[omniperf](https://github.com/ROCm/omniperf) - Advanced Profiling and Analytics for AMD Hardware - e.g. can plot a roofline performance of your AMD accelerator and many other things.
